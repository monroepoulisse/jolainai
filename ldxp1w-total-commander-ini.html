                            <p> I use Windows 7 at work. I got it delivered with the swedish version of the operating system. One little annoyance with it is that the swedish localization translates some folder names. When I browse c:\ the 'users' folder is presented as 'användare' and all users got folders like 'music' which is presented as 'min musik'. This is quite confusing because if I try to reference the path c:\användare it does not exist, even though that is the folder name i click. I've gathered some screenshots. Hey there!

Hi everyone. Have been playing WOTC for a while. After some tests, I think I found a suitable list of mods to use that enhances WOTC gameplay really well without changing it drastically. Let me know if there are any mods you'd like to recommend that could add to the gameplay. Thanks and enjoy! Edit: WOW, thanks for the upvotes!! Here's the list: 1.

During cutscenes, the game occasionally freezes for half a second, then continues normally. During dialogue, characters' lips start moving before any sound comes out. The line cuts off as soon as the characters stop moving their lips. Strangely, these issues happen more often during specific conversations and cutscenes. One example is Navigator Pressly's first line of dialogue: "Congratulations, Commander. Looks. 
###The intro Along with WotC it's been announced that Second Wave options are coming back. Some of them being entirely new, and one in particular that caught my eye: "Beta Strike", which doubles enemy and XCOM's health points alike. The name is very likely a reference to the "Alpha Strike" meta many veterans on this subreddit know, but basically the idea is that by doubling everyone's HP firefights are going to be longer, enemies will get a chance to respond and attack back, your soldiers. Wishlist/ideas/oppinion: Much of this may already be implemented. Much of this maybe not the direction development has gone. Just wanted to say my opinions. 1. WASD option for camera control 2. very large zoom out. Some developers choose to not put it in by default but if multiplayer was allowed to have a ini option like total war has that would be fantastic. 3. Large maps with a higher unit count than COH but more manageable due to zoom/UI improvements. 4. Detailed stats: In Wargame. A (probably non-exhaustive) list of interactions which have a delay: When I trigger traps, they don't fire until 5-10 seconds afterwards (I can very easily move out of the way and avoid damage between the point where I trigger it and the point where it fires). This happens with every trap I've seen- rigged guns, grenade drops, tesla shockers. It does not happen with regular mines. When I pick up bobby pin boxes or cap stashes, it takes ~5 seconds for it to register and add the items I know. I'm lazy. But I made myself a New Years resolution that I would make sure that Beta 15 will be completed this year. Which means I have 'til December, right? --- Happy New Year everyone! Hopefully everyone toasted for another great year for XCOM! ( Here we go, Round 2. I've had to temporarily step away during the holidays, so I was only helping out here and there over the last couple of weeks. However, the rest of the team were going at it through. # Get it here ( --- # BETA 15c2 April 12, 2015 ampnbsp; BETA 15 to BETA 15b or 15c Issues If you are well into a campaign and have researched advanced Medikits, all of your soldiers will suddenly have the Deadeye Perk. If you want to remove it, use the Dev Console and the command GivePerk -116 on that soldier in a tactical mission. Meld costs. Hello fellow Shepard-Commanders! ------------- I just finished my second playthrough of Mass Effect 2 (and 1) and figured I wanted to share all my discoveries in terms of coalesced edits and more. Before going anywhere, I'll tell you there will be spoilers! The reason for all this is because I (being a completionist/perfectionist) wanted to get as much out of the game as possible. Upping the difficulty made it feel more rewarding (we're saving the galaxy after all). Fiddling. This is half to share my idea and half to make sure I stick to my own rules. The challenge is to act similarly to the Guardsmen of the Dawn of War franchise. You don't win by having the best tech or the most elite soldiers. You win by flooding the enemy with fire and/or bodies. The Rules 1) For every 4 Infantry, you can have 1 non infantry soldier or mechanized unit in the barracks. Valkyries count as non-infantry. Officers and psi units count as non-infantry. 2) Only elite. LONG WAR 2 CHANGELOGS 1.1 (Jan. 28, 2017) CLs 1945-2113 Bugfixes - Fixed bug preventing tactical DEs from occurring. This will cause a meaningful increase in difficulty. - Fixed bug causing captured soldiers to not be controllable after hacking the cells in Jailreak missions. - Fixed an array bug that was causing not all tiles to be partitioned correctly when applying explosive environmental damage falloff. - Fixed bug in which build. 
I am currently in the end game of my current play through of LW, so I was looking for suggestions as to what kind of setup i should use for my next one. I don't know if I am going to finish this one because the grind is getting to me, and I personally think the early game was more fun. Current game is vanilla LW on normal with Commander's choice, Friendly skies, and perfect information. I feel like the tactical situation has been fairly okay, I get overconfident sometimes So I finished the WotC campaign on Commander some time ago. I've decided that I was to make my next campaign last much, much longer, and so I edited the config files to increase the Avatar Project meter. I've played 3 campaigns since then, all of them would end when the game freezes and permanently stuck a few hours after spoiler (/s "defeating the Chosen Assassin"). After the first campaign, I deleted all config files, ones in the document folder and the ones in the game directory This post is compilation of information from the UFOpedia ( the Change Log ( comments within the DefaultGameCore.ini file, and my own experience with Second Wave options. EDIT: A special thanks to the commenters that have pointed out the Wiki is outdated, and I'm embarrassed to admit I was going by my own memory in some places. so I've corrected errors in the text and welcom. Hello commanders! I have been off these forums for a while but I am back (for now lol) and wanted to share my opinions for each class in my Impossible run so far. I would like to post about each class in detail so I thought I will make multiple posts with each pertaining to one class in LW. I have been running an Impossible/Honestman run on LW b15f and would like your thoughts on my thoughts (thought-ception!) for each class and how I like using them. First lets talk settings. I am playing. Updated 2015.05.27 My purposes here at /r/Xcom are twofold    to assemble all of the currently available resources into an up to date digest, and then to make that digest easily accessible to new users with a simple search of /r/xcom for “Long War 101”. First Things First Read the “Read Me” text file that is included with the Long War installer package. Seriously. Read it twice. The vast majority of questions are answered in that document. Check out the Long War Forums. Having just played a landed Harvester mission that I found quite frustrating I thought it might be worth discussing it here to see if anyone else has had similar concerns. Just to make my position clear overall I love the game, and the long war mod especially, and have a huge amount of respect for the massive amount of skill and effort that has been put into it's development. This mission in question was a Harvester landing in mid April. Overall the mission was a success. All non command. September 2016, b15c, Normal/Ironman, Commander's Choice, Hidden Potential, Wear and Tear. No .ini edits. I just had a landed Medium UFO with 6 Outsiders on it (2 in the command pod, the other 4 patrolling). The mission after that was an abduction on Portent. The first pod I hit had a total of 8 aliens in it (the biggest pod I've seen thus far had 5 aliens in it, so this was a shock in itself). It was made up of a Sectoid Commander, a Sectoid, and 6 Outsiders. Is this just something 
Thread updated as more info is available. Last update: 29 May to prepare the leveling session. ## Latest news: WE PLAY NC!! BR10 leveling tomorrow, Friday evening. ( ###Normal post: Preparations for our match against Cobalt are in full swing! If you don't know what Server Smash is, please take a look at their own subreddit: /r/ServerSmash. You can also watch the stream. Hello Commanders. o7 My name is Wittel and something big, for me at least, is happening this upcoming Monday on February 1st: I will be finishing a campaign, known as Quest For Victory Season 9 to me, in Long War on Impossible (non-Ironman) for the first time on stream. I'm normally not one to promote myself or be excited about much of anything, so why is this a big enough deal to promote/be excited for? Well there are a couple of reasons. 1) X2 is coming out the following Friday Long War b15f Modlist for New Players Play on Normal. You can move up to Classic if you feel really daring. Second Wave Options : Enable Hidden Potential, Dynamic War, Friendly Skies, Commander's Choice, Durability, Perfect Information Optionally enable Aiming Angles. Always enable Durability and Dynamic War. Enable Cinematic mode if you are not using my .ini Which, incidentally, cuts out some of the less interesting parts of LW. Namely, it alleviates the resource grind
